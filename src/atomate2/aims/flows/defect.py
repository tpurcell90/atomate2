    Maker class to calculate formation energy diagrams. The main settings for
    this maker is the `relax_maker` which contains the settings for the atomic
    relaxations that each defect supercell will undergo.

    If the `validate_maker` is set to True, the maker will check for some basic
    settings in the `relax_maker` to make sure the calculations are done correctly.

    Attributes
    ----------
    defect_relax_maker: Maker
        A maker to perform an atomic-position-only relaxation on the defect charge
        states.

    bulk_relax_maker: Maker | None
        If None, the same `defect_relax_maker` will be used for the bulk supercell.
        A maker to used to perform the bulk supercell calculation.

    name: str
        The name of the flow created by this maker.

    relax_radius:
        The radius to include around the defect site for the relaxation.
        If "auto", the radius will be set to the maximum that will fit inside
        a periodic cell. If None, all atoms will be relaxed.

    perturb:
        The amount to perturb the sites in the supercell. Only perturb the
        sites with selective dynamics set to True. So this setting only works
        with `relax_radius`.

    collect_defect_entry_data: bool
        Whether to collect the defect entry data at the end of the flow.
        If True, the output of all the charge states for each symmetry distinct
        defect will be collected into a list of dictionaries that can be used
        to create a DefectEntry. The data here can be trivially combined with
        phase diagram data from the materials project API to create the formation
        energy diagrams.
